## About the site

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/profile.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt=""/></span>
My name is Aryan Mahesh. I am 19 years old and studying in the Singapore University of Technology and Design (under Enginering Product Development). I am passionate about science, computers, programming, science fiction, writing and art. This site is a collection of my work from 2015 to the present day. I post about my embedded systems projects, sketches, astrophysics and stories that I write.

I started my embedded systems journey in 2018 when I took part in an inter-school robotics contest. Since then, I have been learning the principles of embedded systems, focusing on Computer Vision systems and OpenCV. I primarily use Python in my projects and I am currently using the Jetson Nano development kit to deploy my code. [The Embedded Systems category](https://aryanaut.github.io/embedded-systems.html) serves as my repository for all things programming-related that I work on.

I have been sketching and drawing since I was in the third grade. I would often fill up sketchbooks with manga-inspired pen and ink sketches and scenes from my favorite pieces of sci-fi. For my tenth birthday, my parents gifted me a graphic tablet for my birthday after which my father, who works in 3D graphics, introduced me to Blender. Since then I have created digital art using Photoshop and 3D renders using Blender. [The Artwork Category](https://aryanaut.github.io/artwork.html) is a collection of all my artwork along with what I had to say about it. My [Portfolio](https://aryanaut.github.io/portfolio/) showcases my best work.

I also occassionally write stories in the science fiction genre which are featured [here](https://aryanaut.github.io/writing.html).

I found what is possibly the strangest writing I've ever seen written by my fourth grade self. I present to you the unfiltered, Bank Gothic font edition of "The Day I Met My Match." - written by me in 4th grade. I won't even tell you the premise because I doubt anyone's expecting this.

Here's the sketches I made for it.

That's all I have for now.

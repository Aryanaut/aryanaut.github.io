As of today, I've taken up the challenge of finishing every program in Mahesh Venkitachalam (my dad)'s [Python Playground](https://nostarch.com/pythonplayground) - a collection of Python programming projects full of art, music and simulations. I've read up on my first chapter and am planning on implementing it very soon, so stay tuned.
